  [Learn to make a MERN APP]
# test2 [webdev-intern-assignment]
 
I'm still working on this project. It still has some unfinished functions. But I find it adaptable to your requirements.


# How to run this App:
1. You just need to clone
2. 'npm i' to install node_module in both frontend and backend folders
3. 'npm start' for frontend
4. 'npm run dev' for backend


#Account (Admin)
- Username: phuc.11102001@gmail.com 
- Password: 123 

- You can create another account by yourself and it will default to the GENERAL (reader) role, however you can edit the role using the ADMIN account.
- I'm using MongoDB Atlas Cloud Platform, so you no need to care how to set up database, the link to connect to Database is in the .env file


# Must have
- Registration / Login (✓)
- User authorization (admin, editor, reader) (✓)
# Nice to have
- Article system (CRUD) (✓)
  
- Scalable system (e.g., adding a new type of user) (use can add more role of user in 'frontend\src\common\role.js'  Adjust the user's information structure in '\backend\models\userModel.js')
  
- Any other features you think are necessary (I'm still working on this project, I think I will add a chatbot to help customers find products that match their thoughts)
